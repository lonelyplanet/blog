excerpt: A discussion on the personalities of pairing

**A discussion on the personalities of pairing**

Pair programming is an excellent method of producing quality software, minimising business risk and making everyone in the team smarter. It can be a fun social activity for those of us of the nerd persuasion. And it can also be frustrating, boring, aggravating and a waste of time. I'm interested in what makes a pair gel, how to maximise the good times and minimise the not-so-good times. I'm not a clinical researcher, just a software developer writing from personal experience and those of my peers. Hopefully this will kickstart a discussion that can make us all a little more self aware as we pair thereby increasing the quality of software we produce.

Pair programming is good for business and good for programmers, that's what repeated studies tell us. There are a lot of resources out there on how to pair program and some resources on how to do it well, most of which focus on the code. Code is simple. Once you write it down it stays written down, has repeatable outcomes and doesn't self-mutate over time (yet). We can write standards and rules and heuristics for writing code in pairs and measure the outcomes and draw conclusions. People on the other hand are only consistent in their inconsistency, don't always produce the same outputs with the same inputs and often don't have compatible interfaces. Understanding what we bring to the pair can help us moderate our own less helpful characteristics and develop useful ones. Below is a list of pair programming archetypes with pros and cons for each. Like all attempts at categorisation you probably won't fit entirely into one box but are more likely to be a combination of several. Becoming aware of which categories you fall into will help you to lean into the strengths of the archetype and also to minimise those that interfere with effective pairing. This list isn't designed to make you feel superior or inadequate, we've all had our n00b days and our master days. By no means is this list meant to be exhaustive, add your own to help us all become nicer pairs.

##### The Finger-Operated Coder
Thinks best while typing. Expresses himself[*](#footnote) in written code on the screen rather than words.

 * **Pros:** Knows all the keyboard shortcuts for everything. Good at generating ideas when the pair is stuck. A very fast typist who will own you at [this](http://drop.notch.net/).

 * **Cons:** Keyboard hog, tends to get really fidgety when not in the drivers seat. Trouble explaining ideas so can leave his pair as a spectator rather than a participant. Can feel like he's taking the long way round because he makes his mistakes by writing out the code rather than thinking it through first.

##### The Thinker
Sits in silence and thinks problems through before talking or coding. Generally soft-spoken.

 * **Pros:** Doesn't say much but when she does always says something worth listening to. Will often see big picture problems before they arise.

 * **Cons:** Can be hard for her pair to tell if she's thinking or catatonic. May look like she's not paying attention. Won't always communicate all the useful things she knows/has thought of.

##### The Cheerleader
Very supportive, engaged pair who thinks almost everything his pair does is awesome. Slow to criticise, quick to praise.

 * **Pros:** Fun and easy to work with. A good sounding board for ideas and trying new things. Confidence building.

 * **Cons:** Not critical enough. Often focused on the immediate code and not the bigger picture. Too quick to take a passenger role.

##### The Master
Knows she is the smartest person in the room, and by certain measures probably is. An expert on the tools and technologies under development.

 * **Pros:** A fantastic learning resource for coding, architecture, optimisation and general design. Able to anticipate issues before they arise.

 * **Cons:** Often wants to try new things just because they are new and not because they are necessary. If she is not interested in sharing her knowledge, pairing with her can be frustrating. She can also be a keyboard hog.

##### The N00b
A newcomer to the codebase, or coding, or someone who knows less than his pair.

 * **Pros:** Asks 'stupid' questions that can often lead to code improvements or uncovering of bugs. Code in need of refactoring becomes obvious when explained to a n00b. Has fresh eyes. By pairing with a n00b and teaching him what you know you are making your team a more powerful force for good coding in the world.

 * **Cons:** Requires his pair to have patience and the ability to explain things properly. Can slow down development in the short term.

##### The Surfer
Has to show you the latest YouTube/Wiki/HN/Twitter video/article/tweet/pic/site/page, you will totally love it.

 * **Pros:** Great for giving a pair a mental spa break after sustained heavy thinking. Fills in those dull moments waiting for tests to run. A great source of cool new stuff to try out.

 * **Cons:** One cool link can turn into two, or ten without sufficient self-control. The [Internet is a Playground](http://www.27bslash6.com/) but you need to get off the swings and work.

##### The Enforcer
Has read everything on OOD, BDD, DDD, TDD, FP, XP and all the other acronyms. Writes code that conforms to the latest and best standards.

 * **Pros:** Ensures her pair write rock solid code which never cuts corners. Strong awareness of the impact of technical debt and great at avoiding it. Excellent learning resource for best code practices.

 * **Cons:** Spends too much time creating scaffolding for disposable code. Can prioritise academic application of standards over pragmatic progamming.

##### The Talker
Does his best thinking while talking so talks a lot.

 * **Pros:** Excellent at explaining problems and solutions. Inspires new ideas or ways of tackling issues because he is a constant brainstorming session.

 * **Cons:** Can dominate a pair, more of an ideas hog than a keyboard hog. Can be distracting to archetypes that prefer to do their thinking in silence.

##### The Vault
Assumes her position at the keyboard and begins to code. Nothing gets in or out, will not talk or surrender control of the machine.

 * **Pros:** Great for those days when you're writing your novel in your head. An excellent challenge for those who like safe cracking.

 * **Cons:** Not really pair programming.

##### The Vacancy
It is 4pm on a Friday, you are going to the beach for the weekend and have remembered you forgot to pack your towel. Also you didn't get much sleep last night and you're hungry. Oh, and you've got the flu and you are hungover. The person sitting next to you is programming, but you are not.

 * **Pros:** We've all been there.

 * **Cons:** Give up and take yourself off to write some documentation or do some useful but mindless task. Sometimes you've got to recognise when you're not going to be an effective pair and just walk away.
