If you use gvim and don't like the default colour scheme, you may have noticed changes to it wont persist between sessions. Add the following line to the following file to fix this
--- CSS
colorscheme slate
---
<i>Note: Replace slate with the theme of your choice (case sensitive)</i>
--- CSS
sudo gvim ~/.gvimrc 
---
<i>Note: This file may not exist, simply create it if it does not</i>

Happy coding
