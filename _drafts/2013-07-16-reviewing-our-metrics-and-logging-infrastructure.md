title: Reviewing our Metrics and Logging Infrastructure
---

Since moving lonelyplanet.com to our new cloudy home we've forced ourselves to take a look at the infrastructure we've been running, and re-evaluate where we want to spend our efforts.

What seemed like a simple agenda turned out to be incredibly difficult to process, and even harder to prioritise.The summarised outcome was:

- Improve our deployment process
- Spend less time maintaining our Metrics service
- Spend less time maintaining our Logging service
