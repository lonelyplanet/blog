Here's a quick one for ya, execute a previously run command

<pre>
$ history | grep firefox
  176  /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
  177  /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
$ !176
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
</pre>

Simple and nifty enough ay, grep history for w/e you're looking for and then bang the number :D
