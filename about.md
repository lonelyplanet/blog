Lonely Planet is a leading provider of travel information. Our guidebooks dominate the market and we're taking this success into the digital frontier. The SPP dev team develops the platform that creates, manages and publishes our content in all formats; we're at the heart of the business, supporting everything LP does.
We're always looking for new talent. Our application is written in Rails and Backbone, but smart hackers can adapt, so we're more interested in what you've built than what you've built it in.

## Stuff we work with

There's more to our content than just words in books. We maintain:
 - points of interest (POIs), the individual destinations like sights, hotels, restaurants and more that create the travel experience
 - places, the geographical areas that contain POIs (and other places), along with their maps
 - narrative, the information from experts that makes our content more than just a review.

The underlying platform we develop:

 - facilitates content authoring and editing
 - makes content curation possible
 - produces digital formats for both electronic and print publishing endpoints
 - digitises content from plain formats
 - integrates cartographic data with content
 - manages data for our partners, who use our content in various ways.

## Milestones

### Offline

Our authors are often on the road, writing about their experiences as they go. Internet connections aren't guaranteed, so they need our platform to work whether they are connected or not. We've met that need with an offline browser app full of client-side awesome.

### Christo

Named after [the artist](http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/), Christo is the app that authors and editors use to work with all of our content in digital form.

### AWS

AWS is now at the core of our platform. CI, staging, prod and training environments all sit happily in the cloud, where we even run our dev test suites. 

### Chef

Our infrastructure is described by our git repo, just like our apps. Chef drives the creation and maintenance of our platform.

### Krishna

We have books full of content that we're bringing into the online era. To assist the team digitising the content and automate as much as possible, we created an app that can take plain text and turn it into cross referenced content rich with POI and place info.

## Our Tools and Tech

The platform includes:

 - CoffeeScript, JavaScript
 - BackboneJS
 - Sass
 - Haml
 - Rails 3, Ruby 1.9
 - PostgreSQL and PostGIS
 - CI - Jenkins
  - Build times are kept low by scaling the build infrastructure in AWS and running matrix builds in parallel.

We use tools like:

 - Sublime Text
 - RSpec, Capybara and Jasmine
 - Git, GitHub, SourceTree and GitX .

## How we work

We're a Kanban driven team that takes a Lean, collaborative approach to development. Our day to day includes:

 - BDD
 - TDD
 - pair programming
 - daily standup
 - chocolate.

We also regularly hold:

 - tech sessions to share our learning
 - retrospectives to help with continuous improvement
 - developer days, where we can work on stuff that's caught our interest but isn't in the immediate queue
 - hack days, where we work on anything.
