Dear Jo,

It has been a while since the last time we pair-programmed. And I miss it. I really miss it.

Is it because you don't want to pair with me? Or because you'd rather work alone?

If it's just me that you don't want to work with then fine - I get it! But remember when I showed you that `Command+Fn+F2` bookmarks a line of code in Sublime Text? You said it was awesome and kept telling me for the whole month how useful the shortcut was. I have heaps of other [tricks and shortcuts](/2014/06/17/GitHub-Tips-n-Tricks.html) that are even cooler. Well, you won't get to learn them if you refuse to sit down and write code with me.

Jo, sorry for being rude. I didn't mean to. In fact, I look up to you. I also appreciate the knowledge you have shared with me. You always see problems with the code while I am looking in the wrong place.

You know I'm not so good with words. Even when I don't say it, I really enjoy working with you. We were so productive together. Avoiding making silly mistakes or typos when I don't code alone has saved me a lot of time. And when we were not writing code, it was also fun talking to you. Once when we were waiting for the build to run, you told me about your adventures in Asia (and the conversation continued on over a beer in the evening). I miss stories like that.

I apologise because I [can't think without having my hands on the keyboard](/2013/08/09/Nice-Pair---Pair-Programming-Archetypes.html) and my excessive typing irritates you. But I am working on it. Just give me some time, alright? I promise I will remember to fold my hands neatly on the desk after I'm done. Or you can just say "Hey, can I try something?" and I will back away from the keyboard.

Jo, if you read this letter, I just want to let you know that I hope we can pair more. Next time you see me, would you please tap me on the shoulder and say "Hey, do you want to pair?"

Sincerely,

Anh
