Evening guys,

Created a basic Sinatra template as I couldn't find one with everything in it. Have put it up on "Github":https://github.com/mriddle/sinatra_template feel free to fork it.

It comes integrated with:
 * SASS
 * HAML
 * Coffee-script
 * Sprockets (asset pipeline)
 * Underscore & Backbone JS
 * RSpec
 * MongoDB

If I get some more time this week I might clone it and create a new one with Jasmine/AngularJS.

Hope it saves people time :)

-Matt
