We're excited here at Lonely Planet to be sponsoring one of Nashville's largest tech conferences coming up November 14-15, 2015! The keynotes from household names [Yehuda Katz](http://twitter.com/wycats), [Douglas Crockford](https://plus.google.com/+DouglasCrockfordEsq/posts), and [Ed Finkler](http://funkatron). This year they're prediciting close to 500 attendees.

Be sure to give shout outs to the 3 organizers, [William Golden](https://twitter.com/egdelwonk), [Jason Myers](http://twitter.com/jasonamyers), and [Kevin Old](http://twitter.com/kevinold). Those guys have been working hard to make Nodevember 2015 even bigger than last year.

Early bird tickets are still on sale now, register at http://nodevember.org. The conference will take place at Libscomb University. Other sponsors include, Walmart, HCA, Leankit, EventBright, Modulus, Lipscomb, Jet Brains, and Stratasan. 

You can see videos from last year on [Nodevember's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nodevember). Look for LP Devs in our Lonely Planet t-shirts and say hey.
